Seafowl is an analytical database for modern data-driven Web applications.

Its CDN and HTTP cache-friendly query execution API lets you deliver data to your visualizations,
dashboards and notebooks by running SQL straight from the user's browser.

## Features

### Fast analytics...

Seafowl is built around
[Apache DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html), a fast and
extensible query execution framework. It uses [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) columnar
storage, making it perfect for analytical workloads.

For `SELECT` queries, Seafowl supports a large subset of the PostgreSQL dialect. If there's
something missing, you can
[write a user-defined function](https://splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/guides/custom-udf-wasm) for
Seafowl in anything that compiles to WebAssembly.

In addition, you can write data to Seafowl by
[uploading a CSV or a Parquet file](https://splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/guides/uploading-csv-parquet),
creating an external table or using
[standard SQL statements](https://splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/guides/writing-sql-queries).

### ...at the edge

Seafowl is designed to be deployed to modern serverless environments. It ships as a single binary,
making it simple to run anywhere.

Seafowl's architecture is inspired by modern cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery,
letting you separate storage and compute. You can store Seafowl data in an object storage like S3 or
Minio and scale to zero. Or, you can
[build a self-contained Docker image](https://splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/guides/baking-dataset-docker-image)
with Seafowl and your data, letting you deploy your data to any platform that supports Docker.

Seafowl's query execution API follows HTTP cache semantics. This means you can
[put Seafowl behind a CDN](https://splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/guides/querying-cache-cdn) like
Cloudflare or a cache like Varnish and have query results cached and delivered to your users in
milliseconds. Even without a cache, you can get the benefits of caching query results in your user's
browser.

## Quickstart

Start Seafowl:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    -e SEAFOWL__FRONTEND__HTTP__WRITE_ACCESS=any \
    splitgraph/seafowl:nightly
```

Or download it from [the releases page](https://github.com/splitgraph/seafowl/releases) and run it
without Docker:

```bash
./seafowl
```

Add a Parquet dataset from HTTP:

```bash
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/q -d@- <<EOF
{"query": "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tripdata \
STORED AS PARQUET \
LOCATION 'https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2022-01.parquet'"}
EOF

curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/q \
  -d '{"query": "CREATE TABLE tripdata AS SELECT * FROM staging.tripdata"}'
```

Run a query:

```bash
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/q \
  -d@-<<EOF
{"query": "SELECT
    EXTRACT(hour FROM tpep_dropoff_datetime) AS hour,
    COUNT(*) AS trips,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount,
    AVG(tip_amount / total_amount) AS tip_fraction
  FROM tripdata
  WHERE total_amount != 0
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 4 DESC"}
EOF

{"hour":21,"trips":109685,"total_amount":2163599.240000029,"tip_fraction":0.12642660660636984}
{"hour":22,"trips":107252,"total_amount":2154126.55000003,"tip_fraction":0.12631676747865359}
{"hour":19,"trips":159241,"total_amount":3054993.040000063,"tip_fraction":0.1252992155287979}
{"hour":18,"trips":183020,"total_amount":3551738.5100000845,"tip_fraction":0.1248666037263193}
{"hour":20,"trips":122613,"total_amount":2402858.8600000343,"tip_fraction":0.12414978866883832}
{"hour":1,"trips":45485,"total_amount":940333.4000000034,"tip_fraction":0.12336981088023881}
...
```

## Documentation

See the [documentation](https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/getting-started/introduction) for
more guides and examples. This includes a longer
[tutorial](https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/seafowl/getting-started/tutorial-fly-io/introduction),
following which you will:

- Deploy Seafowl to [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
- Put it behind Cloudflare CDN or Varnish
- Build an interactive [Observable](https://observablehq.com) notebook querying data on it, just
  like [this one](https://observablehq.com/@seafowl/interactive-visualization-demo)

## Pre-built binaries and Docker images

We do not yet provide full build instructions, but we do produce binaries and Docker images as
prebuilt artifacts.

### Release builds

You can find release binaries on our [releases page](https://github.com/splitgraph/seafowl/releases)

### Nightly builds

We produce nightly binaries after every merge to `main`. You can find them in GitHub Actions
artifacts (only if you're logged in, see
[this issue](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/51)) or **via
[nightly.link](https://nightly.link/splitgraph/seafowl/workflows/nightly/main)**:

- [Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)](https://nightly.link/splitgraph/seafowl/workflows/nightly/main/seafowl-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip)
- [OSX (x86_64-apple-darwin)](https://nightly.link/splitgraph/seafowl/workflows/nightly/main/seafowl-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip)
- [Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)](https://nightly.link/splitgraph/seafowl/workflows/nightly/main/seafowl-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

### Docker images

We produce [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/splitgraph/seafowl/tags) on every merge to
`main`.

- Release builds are tagged according to their version, e.g. `v0.1.0` results in
  `splitgraph/seafowl:0.1.0` and `0.1`.
- Nightly builds are tagged as `splitgraph/seafowl:nightly`

## Long-term feature roadmap

There are many features we're planning for Seafowl. Where appropriate, we'll also aim to upstream
these changes into DataFusion itself.

### Support for JSON functions and storage

We're planning on adding the JSON datatype to Seafowl, as well as a suite of functions to
manipulate/access JSON data, similar to the
[functions supported by PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) .

### PostgreSQL-compatible endpoint

This will make Seafowl queryable by existing BI tools like Metabase/Superset/Looker.

### Federated querying

You will be able to add other databases and external data sources to Seafowl, letting it query them
"live".
